# COMPS and Jupyter `v0.0.1`

Demonstrations of transactions between **Jupyter Notebooks** and IDM's **Computational Modeling Platform Service** (COMPS).

COMPS provides for the submission, execution, and management of computational simulations on high-performance computing clusters (HPC). COMPS employs a scaleable RESTful service architecture, including a internet accessible website, [comps.idmod.org](https://comps.idmod.org).
